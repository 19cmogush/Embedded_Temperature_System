# Embedded_Temperature_System
This is a temperature sensor project for the arduino that uses the ds18b20 temperature sensor to find room temperature values and allows user to change 
temperature threshhold allowed. When temperature crosses threshhold a light begins to blink red. And when it is 2 degrees above threshold a musical note chosen 
by the user is played.
